      Neighbour Zone is a local community platform designed to bring neighbours
      closer together.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a time where people often live next to each other without really
      connecting, Neighbour Zone makes it easy to discover who lives nearby,
      share items, organize local events and help one another in a trusted
      environment.
    </p>
